# 🖥️ ClientCLI — JavaFX Graphical Command-Line Interface

## Overview
The **ClientCLI** class is a JavaFX-based graphical command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with a remote command execution server (`ScriptServer`) through a network connection managed by `ScriptClient`.  
It mimics the behavior of a traditional command-line terminal while providing the benefits of a modern GUI — such as styled output, input history, and smooth asynchronous execution.

---

## Purpose
This client application is designed to provide a secure and interactive environment for executing server-side scripts or commands remotely.  
It acts as the **frontend layer** of the system, enabling administrators or users to:
- Send shell-like commands to a remote backend
- View execution output or logs in real time
- Maintain a history of executed commands for quick navigation
- Operate with minimal delay via persistent network connections

---

## Key Features

### 🧭 Command Input and History
- Users can type commands into the input field.
- Pressing **Enter** sends the command to the remote server.
- The application maintains a **command history**, allowing navigation with the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys.
- Commands are stored in memory and preserved throughout the session for user convenience.

### 🪶 Output Display
- The output from the remote server is displayed in a **scrollable, read-only console** area.
- Messages are appended chronologically, emulating a terminal feed.
- The UI uses a **dark theme** for better contrast and readability.
- Output automatically scrolls to the latest message after each response.

### ⚙️ Command Execution
- Commands are executed asynchronously in a background thread to prevent the JavaFX UI from freezing.
- The `CommandManager` class communicates with the `ScriptClient`, which sends the command to the `ScriptServer` via TCP.
- Responses are streamed back to the GUI in near real time.

### 💾 Server Communication
- On startup, the client establishes a persistent socket connection to a remote server (default host: `server-vm`, port: `5000`).
- Commands are serialized into plain text and sent line-by-line.
- The server executes predefined shell scripts (based on the received command) and sends the results back.
- The client displays this output directly in the interface.

### 🧱 Layout and Styling
- The application uses a **BorderPane** layout with the command output area on top and an input field at the bottom.
- Visual appearance is controlled by an external CSS file (`cli-style.css`), providing a consistent theme.
- The interface is designed for readability and a “developer console” aesthetic.

## Application Flow

1. **Startup**
   - JavaFX initializes the window.
   - The client establishes a TCP connection to the `ScriptServer`.
   - A startup banner is displayed, introducing the interface.

2. **Command Input**
   - The user types a command in the input field and presses Enter.
   - The command is recorded in the session history.

3. **Server Communication**
   - The `CommandManager` sends the command to the `ScriptServer` using `ScriptClient`.
   - The server executes the associated shell script and streams output back.

4. **Output Display**
   - The response is displayed in the `TextArea` console, formatted line-by-line.
   - The scroll position updates automatically to show the newest output.

5. **History Navigation**
   - The user can press **Up** or **Down** arrows to cycle through previously executed commands.

6. **Shutdown**
   - When the user closes the window, the client sends an `"exit"` command to gracefully disconnect from the server.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Required | Default |
|------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| *(none)* | The application takes no command-line arguments by default. Connection details are hardcoded but can be parameterized. | — | Host: `server-vm`, Port: `5000` |

## Output Example
When connected, the application displays a header and processes typed commands. A typical session might look like:
