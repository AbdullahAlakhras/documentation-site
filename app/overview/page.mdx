# 🌐 Project Overview — Distributed Command Execution System

## 🧭 Summary
This project implements a **distributed command execution and monitoring system** consisting of one central **server VM** and two **client VMs**.  
It enables remote command processing, file transfer, and status reporting through a secure, script-based backend and a JavaFX-powered client interface.

The setup allows multiple clients to send requests or scripts to the central server, which executes them, processes outputs, and returns structured results — all while maintaining operational logs and system health checks.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 🖥️ Virtual Machines Overview

| Role | Hostname | Username | Password | Description |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Server VM** | `server-vm` | `server` | `123` | Central command processor and script execution node. |
| **Client VM 1** | `client-vm` | `client` | `123` | User-facing workstation running the GUI client (JavaFX CLI). |
| **Client VM 2** | `client2-vm` | `client2` | `123` | Secondary client for multi-user testing and distributed operations. |

## 🧩 Components

### 🧱 1. Server Side (`server-vm`)
The **server** acts as the core of the system — receiving, processing, and responding to client requests.

**Key Elements:**
- **`ScriptServer.java`**  
  - Runs a TCP server on port `5000`.
  - Listens for incoming commands from clients.
  - Maps command strings (e.g., `analyze`, `deploy`) to corresponding shell scripts.
  - Executes scripts on demand and streams the output back to clients.
- **Shell Scripts**  
  Located in `/home/server/S25-01/server/` and perform automated tasks such as:
  - File validation and queue handling  
  - Log collection and system health metrics  
  - Process monitoring and analysis  
- **Systemd Worker Service**  
  - Runs `worker.sh` continuously (24/7) to process queued tasks.
  - Generates result files and logs under `/home/server/results/`.

### 💻 2. Client Side (`client-vm`, `client2-vm`)
Each client acts as a **remote operator** that can send commands to the server and view responses interactively.

**Key Elements:**
- **`ClientCLI.java` (JavaFX App)**  
  Provides a terminal-like GUI for command input and result display.
- **`ScriptClient.java`**  
  Handles TCP socket communication with the server.
- **`CommandManager.java`** *(helper class)*  
  Interfaces between the UI and the networking layer to send user commands and receive responses.

**Typical Command Flow:**
1. User launches the **ClientCLI** GUI.
2. The app automatically connects to `server-vm:5000`.
3. User types a command
4. **Client retrieves results** automatically or on request, displaying the summary in the GUI.

## 🧭 Summary

- The **server VM** acts as the **central controller**.
- The **clients** (two VMs) act as **command initiators**.
- Communication uses **TCP (port 5000)** and **SCP** for file transfer.
- **Worker daemon** runs continuously to process tasks 24/7.
- Results are logged, timestamped, and easily retrievable by each client.

This distributed design allows multiple clients to execute commands concurrently while ensuring reliable job processing and isolation on the server side.
